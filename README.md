- **Soil and Pest Management Resources:** Connection with authoritative sources for soil analysis data, pest identification, and organic pest control methods.

## Project Planning and Version Control

- **Version Control:** Managed using Git with a `main` branch and multiple development branches.
- **Workflow:** Utilize pull requests for merging changes into the `main` branch to facilitate discussion and review.


## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js: Backend development platform, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL: Database for CRUD operations.
- **Postman:** API building, testing and documentation tool.
- **Version Control:** Git: Version control system.
  
## Testing
-**Postman** Testing Strategy
We have employed Postman for comprehensive API testing to ensure the functionality, reliability, and accuracy of the Greenthumb platform. Our testing strategy involves:

-**Automated Tests:** Writing automated test scripts within Postman to perform API endpoint testing, covering scenarios for data submission.

**Environment Setup:** Configuring different environments within Postman to simulate various conditions and perform thorough testing.

**Collection Runs:** Executing collection runs in Postman to validate endpoints, data validations, authentication mechanisms, and error handling.

**Instructions for Testing Using Postman**:

Import the provided Postman collection.
Set up the necessary environment variables, choose the Postman file.
Run collection tests individually or perform a collection run to test various API endpoints.
